This folder contains the data obtained at the UNESP/FEIS laboratory in July 2023 
by the student Lorena Lopes Dias. It shows the data collected for different 
temperatures of the beam without damage. This research was funded by FAPESP, n° 2021/12008-2.

For the undamaged beam, data was collected for a temperature range of 24°C to 70°C w
ith a step of 5°C, except for the first one, which was 6°C. All signals were collected 
during heating. The signals were measured 3 times, i.e. the beam was heated 3 times 
to collect all the signals. 

The names of the data obtained for the undamaged beam have the following representation:

 - SemDano_SinalX_Tempi_1
 where:
	SinalX: 'X' represents the measurement number, which can be equal to 
                1, 2 or 3.
	Tempi: 'i' represents the temperature, which can be equal to: 
               24°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, 45°C, 50°C, 55°C, 60°C, 65°C and 70°C.

Therefore, the signal 'SemDano_Sinal3_Temp45_1' represents the signal obtained for the 
undamaged beam at a temperature of 45°C during the third measurement (heating) of the beam.


The signals are measured in the Time domain and in the Frequency domain.

The signals in the time domain show the time in seconds in the first column and the 
response of the structure in the second column.

Signals in the frequency domain contain the Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) signals. 
The first column corresponds to the frequency in Hz, the second column corresponds 
to the magnitude of the EMI, the third column shows the real part of the EMI, 
while the fourth (and last) column contains the imaginary part of the Electromechanical Impedance signal.
